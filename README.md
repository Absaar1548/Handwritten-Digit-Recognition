# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition MTE Project

The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different flavors. The handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.

In this Project, we have implemented a handwritten digit recognition app using the MNIST dataset. We we have using a special type of deep neural network that is Convolutional Neural Networks.
